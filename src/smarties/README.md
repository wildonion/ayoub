# ðŸ“‘ NEAR Smart Contracts

### Environment Setup
1. Install Rust from https://rustup.rs/
2. Install WSL and ```sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential```
3. Install near cli using ```npm install -g near-cli``` command
4. Run ```rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown```
5. Create near [testnet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/) or [mainnet](https://wallet.near.org/) account

> The default network for near-cli is testnet you can change the network using ```export NEAR_ENV=mainnet``` command.

> To deploy on _mainnet_ you should have an account on mainnet like _wildonion.near_.

> For calling contract methods, the first account name must be the owner of the contract and the second one would be either the contract owner account or another account name. 

> For calling private method inside the contract, `current_account_id` must be equal to `predecessor_account_id` (account of the contract).

### Test
```
$ cargo test --package nearacts --nocapture
```

### Compile
```
$ cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### Deplopy
```
$ ID=wildonion.testnet
$ near login
$ NEAR_ENV=testnet near deploy --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/nearacts.wasm --accountId $ID
```

### Method Call
```
$ NEAR_ENV=testnet near call $ID CONTRACT_INIT_METHOD_NAME '{}' --accountId $ID
```

### The Beauty of Concurrency!

**NOTE** - Due to the time which takes to send and receive each chunks inside threads through the `mpsc` channel asyncly, the result might be different on each run and it depends on the system, but here at first run both input and the result got into an equality condition.
