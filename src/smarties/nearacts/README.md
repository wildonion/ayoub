# ðŸ“‘ NEAR Smart Contracts

### Environment Setup
1. Install Rust from https://rustup.rs/
2. Install WSL and ```sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential```
3. Install near cli using ```npm install -g near-cli``` command
4. Run ```rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown```
5. Create near testnet account from https://wallet.testnet.near.org/create

> The default network for near-cli is testnet you can change the network using ```export NEAR_ENV=mainnet``` command.

### Test
```
$ cargo test --package nearacts --nocapture
```

### Compile
```
$ cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### Deplopy
```
$ near login
$ near deploy --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/nearacts.wasm --accountId wildonion.testnet
```

### The Beauty of Concurrency!

**NOTE** - Due to the time which takes to send and receive each chunks inside threads through the `mpsc` channel asyncly, the result might be different on each run and it depends on the system, but here at first run both input and the result got into an equality condition.
