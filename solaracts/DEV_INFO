compile contracts to wasm and bfp to run inside each node
make trust between two accounts by calling the program id of the deployed contract on a specific event
the address of the deployed bpf bytecode of our campaign contract contains a program id or the contract address
our campaign contract contains some methods like TransferingWithCommission(), LockWallet() and MakeCampaignEmpty()
our campaign contract's methods will be called on a specific event or condition and that's what a smart contract does!
big-endian system stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest (the most right hex will be stored at the bottom of the stack)
use the Solana SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust to call contracts using JSON RPC 
use the Solana Program Crate to write on-chain programs in Rust to deploy bpf contracts on solana runtime
