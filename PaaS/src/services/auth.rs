                                                    THE IDEA BEHIND THE Api STRUCT DESIGN PATTERN
                                                    ---------------------------------------------

    based on the borrowing and ownership rules instead of garbage collection rule, the variable lifetime will be dropped after first usage 
    and to get this rule over we must either clone (Clone trait must be implemented for that type) the variable or borrow its ownership using 
    & in order to have it in later scopes therefore based on the desing pattern of the Api struct we can't bound it to Clone trait thus we can't clone 
    the api object or have api.clone() in multiple scopes inside a single crate like the nodejs express app object therefore the best design pattern 
    would be to return only one response object with a valid lifetime per request (cause the old one will be dropped after we're done with being inside the api methods) 
    in the whole app runtime based on matching the request on one of the available routes; since there is only one initialized api object which contains 
    the current request and a new response object inside the whole runtime in memory, there are no multiple of them at runtime 
    cause we're using match expression to detect the current route. 
    
    
    we've handled every incoming request using one the api object methods (post & get) in a 
    specific controller inside a single crate to implement the above idea!

    we can't borrow the api object cause it'll be a shared reference and can't dereference it 
    a shared reference across other threads and struct methods.
    
    shared reference can't dereference between threads and can't move out of it cause by moving or dereferencing it it'll lose its ownership and lifetime while some methods and 
    threads are using it; we can sovle this using as_ref() method wich converts a &wrapped type into &T or by cloning the type.

    I've choosed this pattern âž” one api object which contains req and res object for the entire lifetime of the app since rust don't have garbage collection.
